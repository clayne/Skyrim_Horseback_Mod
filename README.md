Skyrim Horseback Mod
==

*[Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99015)* 

This mod allows infinitely sprinting on a horse without consuming any stamina, **while on a road**, while still consuming stamina when off-road (e.g. in the fields) - pretty much like in The Witcher 3. Makes things like playing with fast-travel disabled or just riding horses for immersion less painful!

**Skyrim AE** is currently fully supported, but **Skyrim SE** support is ***untested*** - let me know if it works or not ;)

While not required, [Horse Stamina HUD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47076) mod is ***highly recommended*** so that you can see your horse's stamina.

For other modders:

The road detection works by checking if the horse is on a preferred-path navmesh triangle (as marked by yellow-ish fill color in Creation Kit), so if you want to make this mod see roads in modded areas, consider that.
